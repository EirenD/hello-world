# hello-world
Here is where I'll store my ideas and resources, and share and discuss things.

I am a year 13 student and I study Business and Computer science. I realised the potential in web development work and was inspired by some friends to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery and Python. The goal is to be proficient in these and to be able to overcomme intermediate challenges in these areas, and to practice creating websites. I want to be able to 'develop' this into a reliable source of income so that, when I go to Uni (going to Swansea btw), I won't have to depend on a meager wage from working a depressing part-time job at a retail giant. I also enjoy reading and playing the guitar and ukulele. I'd say my most discernible feature is my ginger mane.
Don't hesitate to get in touch if you think we can help each other! I'd love to have a coding buddy so that we can keep each other motivated and inspired.
